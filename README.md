HOW TO LAUNCH:

For WINDOWS users: Run the setup.exe file, choose installation folder and install the game. Launch the game from the EvilGalaxy.exe or from the shortcut on your desktop.

For NON-WINDOWS users: Run the EvilGalaxy.jar file WITHIN its folder. If you remove the .jar file outside the folder, the game resources won't be found, which will result in a failure to load the game.


MANUAL:

Use the arrows to navigate your ship.
Use Space and Ctrl to fire.
Use S to mute the background music and A to enable it.
Use R to resume your game, once paused, and to restart your game, once finished.
Use P for pausing the game.
